         Mincraft is a fun to play single and multiplayer game. It was created in March 17, 2009 by Markus "Notch" and later sold it to microsoft in
         September 2014, after selling 15 million copies of Minecraft across gaming consoles, Notch sold out to Microsoft in a $2.5 billion cash deal.
         In minecraf there 4 diffrent modes 
         <br> <br>
         Survival-In this mode, players have to gather all their materials to build, craft items and tools and gain experience points.
          There is a health, hunger, and armor bar, an inventory, and also a oxygen bar when underwater, suffocating, or in lava. If a player runs out of hearts (health),
           the player dies and returns to the spawn point. Upon death, the player emits smoke, loses all experience and items, and a death message. Maximum reach is 5 blocks.
           <br><br>
          Creative- The player has access to an infinite amount of almost all blocks and items available, and can destroy them instantly. Players are invulnerable, unless they fall into the void,
          and do not have health, armor, or hunger, and can fly. The player has access to items not available in Survival mode, e.g. spawn eggs.
           The player cannot see command blocks if they look through the Creative GUI -
          they need to spawn command blocks with the /give or /setblock commands. Max reach is 6 blocks.
          <br><br>
       Adventure- Players can interact with objects such as levers and buttons, and can interact with mobs. However, 
       they can break blocks only with tools having a CanDestroy data tag, and place blocks only if the block they are holding has a CanPlaceOn data tag,
       making this mode good for adventure maps. Max reach is 5 blocks.
                <br><br>
       Spectator- When in Spectator mode, players can clip through blocks and fly freely. The player can't interact with blocks, entities or their inventory.
          <br><br>
        Hardcore- Hardcore is just like survival but if you die one you can not respawn.
         <br><br><br>
        In minecraft there are diffrent types of versons. The two mainly played versons are jawa and bedrock.
        A major difference between Java and Bedrock is the world format.
        Bedrock uses the LevelDB format for world storage, while Java uses the Anvil format. Due to this,
        most third-party tools created for editing a world will only work in the version for which it was created.
        The two versions also use a fairly different block format. Java has flattened its block format using a unique string for individual blocks, 
        and storing the state of that block separately. Similarly, Bedrock uses a string-based system with block states,
        while some blocks are grouped together by data value. Because of this, blocks are named differently between the versions.
        For example,  granite is defined as stone 1 in Bedrock, while in Java it's referred to as granite. <br><br>
