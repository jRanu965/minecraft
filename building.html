          Structures in Minecraft, just like anything else, have changed over the years. When the game was first released, 
          players were satisfied with a poorly built wooden or dirt shelter. As more people started playing the game, they, too, 
          started trying out new materials and different construction designs and styles. When the game was in Beta in 2010 and 2011, 
          it saw the construction of medieval pixel art, castles, and entire cities.
           Redstone blocks made the construction of mechanical features possible, though, such as doors that opened automatically, 
           as well as traps. In 2011 when the game was released and creative mode was added, players had an unlimited supply of resouces,
            leading to even further skyscrapers, realistic models, fantasy worlds, and all other elaborate wonders. Also over the years,
             more complex designs were made possible as new updates brought new biomes and blocks, as well as new tools. 
             The community contributed quite a bit in the construction of buildings turning to players servers such as Hypixel and Hermitcraft,
              as well as build teams like The Aether and BlockWorks which are known for their professional quality structures. Now, using mods,
               shaders, and other resources to edit the world enables truly breathtaking cities to be built,
                bringing life to these masterpieces and making them more than just fully polished, landscapes or adventure maps.
                <br><br>

          As noted above, the structures within the game can be everything from basic houses to entire elaborate cities, 
          all made with pure skill and creativity and vision. Players can also entreprendre building medieval.
